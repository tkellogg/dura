# Dura

Dura is a background process that watches your Git repositories and commits your uncommitted changes without impacting
HEAD, the current branch, or the Git index (staged files). If you ever get into an "oh snap!" situation where you think
you just lost days of work, checkout a `dura` branch and recover.

Without `dura`, you use Ctrl-Z in your editor to get back to a good state. That's so 2022. Computers crash and Crl-Z
only works on files independently. Dura snapshots changes across the entire repository as-you-go, so you can revert to
"4 hours ago" instead of "hit Ctrl-Z like 40 times or whatever". Finally, some sanity.

## How to use

Launch the daemon:

```bash
$ dura serve &
```

The `serve` can happen in any directory. The `&` is bash syntax to "daemonize" the process, meaning that you can start
`dura` and then keep using the same terminal window while `dura` keeps running. You could also run `dura serve` in a
window that you keep open.

Let `dura` know which repositories to watch:

```bash
$ cd some/git/repo
$ dura watch
```

Right now, you have to `cd` into each repo that you want to watch, one at a time. If you have thoughts on how to do this
better, share them [here](https://github.com/tkellogg/dura/issues/3).

Make some changes. No need to commit or even stage them. Use any Git tool to see the `dura` branches:

```bash
$ git log --all
```

`dura` produces a branch for every real commit you make and makes commits to that branch without impacting your working
copy. You keep using Git exactly as you did before.

## How to recover

The `dura` branch that's tracking your current uncommitted looks like `dura-f4a88e5ea0f1f7492845f7021ae82db70f14c725`.
In bash, you can get the branch name via:

```bash
$ echo "dura-$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

Use `git log` or [`tig`](http://jonas.github.io/tig/) to figure out which commit you want to rollback to. Copy the hash
and then run something like

```bash
# Or, if you don't trust dura yet, `git stash`
$ git reset HEAD --hard
# get the changes into your working directory
$ git checkout $THE_HASH
# last few commands reset HEAD back to master but with changes uncommitted
$ git checkout -b temp-branch
$ git reset master
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -D temp-branch
```

## FAQ

### Is this stable?

It's still in the prototype phase. Open issues pertaining to stability are marked with the
[stability](https://github.com/tkellogg/dura/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astability) tag.

### How often does this check for changes?

Every now and then, like 5 seconds or so. Internally there's a control loop that sleeps 5 seconds between loops, so it
runs less frequently than every 5 seconds (potentially a lot less frequently, if there's a lot of work to do).

### Does this work on my OS?

- Mac: yes
- Linux: probably
- Windows: possibly
